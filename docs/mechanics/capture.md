title: Predominance and capturing worlds
---

Prodominance is a value that is given for each player at each world. Every player gets three predominance per ships and one predominance per population at the particular world. As long as there is population at the world that does not belong to the predominant player, such population is converted with a rate of four population per day.

Caputuring takes place whenever a new owner manages to take the absolute majority of the population. In this case the control over the world is taken over immediately.

Another way to capture a world is to transfer population to lost world. In this case the world is immediately caputered.
