title: Capturing worlds
---

Capturing of worlds happens automatically if you manage to stay the only player present at a world for a timespan of more than two days. You can however place an order for your ships to wait until the world is captured before continuing with the rest of its orders. This is particularly helpful at the beginning of the game where you want to grab as many worlds as possible in a short period of time.
