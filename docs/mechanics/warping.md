Fleet keys are able to warp between adjacent worlds. When warping, fleet keys take all their attached ships as well as their cargo with it. The warp itself takes 2.5 days. However, when leaving or arriving a world that is not your own the departure or arrival is delayed by an additional day. During these delays the fleet located at this world and is attackable by enemy fleets.
