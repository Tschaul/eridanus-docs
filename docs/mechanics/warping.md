title: Warping between worlds
---

Fleetkeys are ablte to warp between adjacent worlds. When warping fleetkeys take all their attached ships as well as their cargo with it. The warp itself akes 2.5 days. However when leaving from an world that is not you own it takes an additional delay of one day to leave the world. And when arriving at a world that is not your own it also takes an additional delay of one day. During both these delays you stay at the world (either where you leave or where you arrive) and are attackable by enemy fleets.
