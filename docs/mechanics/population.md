title: Population growth
---

Population growth acording to an logistic curve. This means that they grow exponentially when far below the population limit. As the population grows the growth rate decrease so that the population saturates at the population limit. The growth rate is highest when the population is equal to half the population limit. At this point it grows by about 20% per week. As population directly feeds into you influence which again determines your vistory points, it is wise to distribute your population across you worlds such that most worlds are close to the optimal growth point.
