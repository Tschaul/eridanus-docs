title: Population growth
---

Population grows according to a logistic curve. This means that population grows exponentially when far below the population limit. As the population grows the growth rate decreases so that the population saturates at the population limit. The growth rate is highest when the population is equal to half of its limit. At this point the population grows by about 20% per week. As population directly feeds into your influence which again determines your vistory points, it is wise to distribute your population across your worlds such that most worlds are close to their optimal growth point.
