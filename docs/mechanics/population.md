title: Population growth
---

Population grows according to a logistic curve. This means that population grows exponentially when far below the population limit. As the population grows the growth rate decreases so that the population saturates at the population limit. The growth rate is highest when the population is equal to half of its limit. At this point the population roughly doubles every. As population are your vistory points, it is wise to distribute your population across your worlds such that most worlds are close to their optimal growth point. Multiple players can have population at one world. When the world is growing the newly generated population gets assigned to one of the players present at the world at random according to their population ratio.
