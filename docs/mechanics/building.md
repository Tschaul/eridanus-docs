title: Building ships and industry
---

Worlds with industry automatically produces fleets with five ships each whenever possible. The time it takes to build depends on the available industry. Each industry needs one population in order to operate. If there is no operated industry no building will take place. The more operated industry is present the faster production will go in proportion.

With 25 operated industry it takes 2.5 days to build a fleet with five ships. With 10 operated industry roughly one week.
