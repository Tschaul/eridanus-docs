title: Building Ships and Industry
---

You can order your world to produce ships for one metal each or industry for five metal each. The time it takes to build depends on the available industry. Each industry at the world needs one population in order to operate, whereby mines also occupy one pupulation each with priority. If there is no operated industry you can not build at that world. The more operated industry is present the faster production will go in proportion.

With one operated industry it takes ten days to build a ship and 50 days to build another industry. With 10 operated industry it takes one day to build a ship and five days to build another industry.
