title: Building ships and industry
---

You can order your worlds to produce ships for one metal each or industry for five metal each. The time it takes to build depends on the available industry. Each industry needs one population in order to operate, whereby mines also occupy one population each with priority. If there is no operated industry you cannot build at that world. The more operated industry is present the faster production will go in proportion.

With one operated industry it takes 10 days to build a ship and 50 days to build another industry. With 10 operated industry it takes one day to build a ship and five days to build another industry.
