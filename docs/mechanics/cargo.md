title: Transporting cargo and transferring ships
---

Fleets have a cargo capacity that is equal to the number of its ships. Each slot of capacity can carry either a metal or a population. Fleets can also transfer their ships to a world, but only those that do not carry a cargo. All transfer orders take one day independent of the transferred amount. Distributing your population and transferring metal from mining world to worlds with industry is an integral part of the game.
