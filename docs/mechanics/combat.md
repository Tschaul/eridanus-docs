Combat takes place automatically. When ships of two players are present at a world they start firing at each other. Every fleet fires at random intervals and does damage proportional to its ships to a random enemy fleet or home fleet. When two fleets with equal amount of ships fight both fleets will loose about half of their ships after one week. When one fleet is twice as big as the other the fight will be over after about six days and the bigger fleet will have lost about one fifth of its ships. This means you will allmost always have the time to either reinforce into a battle or retreat your fleet before you loose them.

Besides the fleet-to-fleet combat there is also collateral damage which happens in parallel. Each hit from an enemy's fleet has a chance to destroy industry and/or kill population. For every four ships destroyed by the enemy there is about two industry destroyed and one population killed at random.
