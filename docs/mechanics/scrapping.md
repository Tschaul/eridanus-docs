title: Scrapping ships for industry
---

In order to bootstrap the industry at a world you can scrap your ships to build industry. Scrapping five ships will be converted into one industry. For worlds without industry this is the only way to build up industry. For worlds with little industry scrapping ships is also often the most feasible way to get additional industry.
