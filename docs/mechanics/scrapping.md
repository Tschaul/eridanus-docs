title: Scrapping ships for industry
---

In order to bootstrap the industry at a world you can scrap you ships to build industry. By each scrapping five ships will be converted to one industry. For worlds without industry this is the only way to get industry onto the worlds. Also for worlds with little industry scapping ships is often the most feasible way to get additional industry.
