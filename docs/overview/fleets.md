Fleets fullfill the following roles:

- Scouting for new worlds and into enemy territory
- Capture new worlds
- Gather metal mined to world with established industry
- Battle opponent ships and conquere their worlds

For all of these roles fleets are able to warp between worlds with a connecting warp gate. When doing so fleets can carry ships, metal and population with them which can be loaded from the source world and dropped at the target world.
