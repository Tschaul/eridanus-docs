Fleets consist of a fleet key and a number ships. Fleets fullfill the following roles:

- Scouting for new worlds and into enemy territory
- Capture new worlds
- Gather metal mined to worlds with established industry
- Battle opponent ships and conquer their worlds

For all of these roles fleets are able to warp between worlds with a connecting warp gate using their fleet key. When doing so fleets can carry metal and population with them which can be loaded from the source world and dropped at the target world. Each ship can carry one metal or one population. 

Fleets need at least one ship to warp between worlds. Warping between your own worlds is faster (2.5 days) that warping to or from a foreign world (3.5 days) or between two foreign worlds (4.5 days).

Capturing of worlds happens automatically as soon as you are the only player present at any given world for a period of two days. You can give your fleet an order to wait for the capturing before continuing with other orders.

When more than one player is present at a world all ships at that world - those from fleets and those from the world - will start firing at opposing ships. You cannot determine the targets explicity, instead the targets are chosen at random. The rate of firing is such that a typical battle will last at least one week.
