Fleets consist of a fleet key and a number ships. Fleets fullfill the following roles:

- Scouting for new worlds and into enemy territory
- Capture new worlds
- Gather metal to worlds with established industry
- Battle opponent ships and conquer their worlds

For all of these roles fleets are able to warp between worlds with a connecting warp gate. When doing so fleets can carry metal and population with them which can be loaded from the source world and dropped at the target world. Each ship can carry one metal and one population. 

Warping between your own worlds is faster (17 hours) than warping to or from a foreign world (20 hours) or between two foreign worlds (24 hours).

Converison of opposing population at worlds happens automatically as soon as you are the predominant player at any given world. Once you controll the absolute majority of the population the world is caputered.

When more than one player is present at a world all ships at that world - those from fleets and those from the world - will start firing at opposing ships. You cannot determine the enemy targets explicity, instead the targets are chosen at random. The rate of firing is such that a typical battle will last at least two to four days.
