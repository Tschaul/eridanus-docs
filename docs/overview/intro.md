Iridanus is a game where you take control over an interstellar civilization spanned across many worlds connected through a network of wormholes. This network is a legacy of a forgotten ancient race. Through artifacts left by the ancients called fleet keys ships can travel the wormholes. As you explore the galaxy you expand to new worlds and exploit their resources to gain more and more influence until you meet other civilizations to which you have to stand up in negotiations and epic battles.

The game is played in slow real time meaning you log into the game every once in a while and leave your orders which then play out over time. You get notified in the case of important events or when new orders are needed.
