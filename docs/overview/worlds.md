Worlds define the territory of your empire and house your population. The player with the most population wins the game. Population grows naturally until a world's population limit is reached. Population growth is fastest at half of the limit. 

Multiple players can have population at a world. In such a case the predominant player converts the other players population over time. Predominance is also influenced by ships present at the world.

In addition worlds can have industry. Every industry needs one population to be operated. When operated industry start building ships whenever there is enough metal present. For one fleet (five ships) five metal is needed. Fleets in turn can then be deployed again to form new industry at any world.
