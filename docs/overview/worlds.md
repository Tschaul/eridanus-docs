Worlds define the territory of your empire. Every world houses population which has multiple purposes:

- Operate mines present on the same world
- Operate industry present on the same world
- Support ships with upkeep throughout the galaxy
- Gain influence which converts to victory points

Mines are already present at worlds when they are discovered and cannot be built. Mines produce a fixed number of metal per week. Industry is intially only present at your home world and has to be built from industry or from deploying/scrapping ships. In order to build ships or additional industry at any world without scrapping ships you need three things:

- Industry
- Population operating the industry
- Metal

Population grows naturally until a world's population limit is reached. Population growth is fastest at half of the limit.
